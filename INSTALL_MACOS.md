# macOS Installation Guide

## Important Security Notice

MonitorSwitch is an open-source application that is **ad-hoc signed** with a free certificate for distribution. This means macOS will show security warnings, which is normal and expected for apps not distributed through the Mac App Store.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download and Extract the ZIP

1. Download `MonitorSwitch-macOS.zip` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/aerodomigue/MonitorSwitch/releases)
2. Double-click the ZIP file to extract it
3. You'll see a folder containing `MonitorSwitch.app` and installation instructions

### Step 2: Install the Application

1. Copy `MonitorSwitch.app` to your **Applications** folder
2. Go to your Applications folder  
3. **Right-click** on `MonitorSwitch.app` and select **"Open"**
4. Click **"Open"** when macOS shows the security warning
5. The app will launch and run normally from future launches

## Alternative Method

If the right-click method doesn't work:

1. Try to open the app normally (it will be blocked)
2. Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General**
3. You'll see a message about MonitorSwitch being blocked
4. Click **"Open Anyway"**
5. Confirm by clicking **"Open"** in the dialog

## Why These Warnings Appear

- MonitorSwitch is **ad-hoc signed** (free signing method for open-source projects)
- Apps need a paid Apple Developer certificate ($99/year) to avoid these warnings
- The warnings don't indicate actual malware - they're just Apple's way of ensuring you consciously choose to run unsigned apps

## After Installation

Once you've completed the initial setup, MonitorSwitch will run normally like any other Mac app. You only need to do the right-click process once for both the DMG and the app.
